A little improvement of timebend's solution for FN keys on dell venue pro 11


This version of timebend's script (http://timebend.com/venue11fix) allows you to still use the dedicated volume buttons on the tablet.
This is possible by using GetKeyState function to check whether the keypress is artificial (in the keyboard one) or physical (the side buttons).
